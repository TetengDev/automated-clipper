# Deployment Plan

## Infrastructure

- **Server:** Hetzner CPX41 (8 vCPU, 16 GB RAM; sized for Remotion's headless Chromium renders) running Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, with a 200 GB volume mounted at `/srv/clipper`.
- **DNS:** an A record for `clips.<domain>` pointing at the server.
- **Services (Docker Compose):**

| Service | Role |
|---|---|
| `monitor` | Polls YouTube and Twitch, enqueues jobs, runs the janitor and health checks |
| `worker` (1–2) | Runs the stage state machine (audio → transcript → selection → EDL → sections → Remotion render) |
| `review` | FastAPI review app |
| `caddy` | Reverse proxy, automatic HTTPS, basic_auth |

The services share a SQLite database (WAL mode) and a media volume. All of them use `restart: unless-stopped` and Docker healthchecks. Logs are JSON written to stdout.

## Provisioning (`scripts/provision.sh`, idempotent)

- Create a non-root `deploy` user. Allow SSH key login only; disable root login and password authentication.
- Configure `ufw` to allow only ports 22, 80, and 443. Install `fail2ban` and `unattended-upgrades`.
- Install Docker Engine and the compose plugin. Set the timezone to UTC.
- Create the directory layout under `/srv/clipper`: `data/`, `output/`, `config/`, `.env` (with `chmod 600`).
- Run `chown -R 10001:10001 data output`. The containers run as uid 10001 and need write access.
- `data/models/` (or `CLIPPER_MODELS_DIR`) holds the face-detection model. The worker fetches it once from Google's storage and checks its pinned SHA-256; without it, clips keep the blurred-fill layout.

## Secrets

`/srv/clipper/.env` exists only on the server and is never committed. It holds:

- `YOUTUBE_API_KEY`, `TWITCH_CLIENT_ID`, `TWITCH_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `PEXELS_API_KEY`, `PIXABAY_API_KEY`
- `GROQ_API_KEY`, only with `transcriber: groq` (transcription runs locally by default; see [Local transcription](#local-transcription))
- `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL`, `DISCORD_ALERTS_WEBHOOK_URL`, `HEALTHCHECK_URL_*`
- `REVIEW_PASSWORD_HASH`, `SESSION_SECRET`, `RCLONE_REMOTE`
- the restic credentials

GitHub Actions secrets contain only the SSH key, host, and user.

## Local transcription

The worker transcribes with faster-whisper on CPU (`transcriber: local`, the default).

- **Models**: only the pinned names in `clipper.config.WHISPER_MODELS` are accepted (tiny,
  base, small, medium, large-v3, large-v3-turbo), each at a fixed Hugging Face commit. The
  first job downloads the snapshot into `CLIPPER_MODELS_DIR` (`/app/data/models` on the
  data volume in compose), which needs outbound HTTPS to huggingface.co once. Download
  size: tiny 75 MB, medium 1.5 GB, large-v3-turbo 1.6 GB, large-v3 3.1 GB. After that,
  transcription runs offline (`HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1`).
- **Isolation**: each 10 min chunk runs in its own child process (`python -I -m
  clipper.pipeline.local_asr`), one at a time, with a hard timeout, an allowlisted
  environment (no API keys) and a 12 GiB address-space limit. The model is loaded per chunk
  (a few seconds from the page cache) and its memory is freed when the child exits.
  `HF_ENDPOINT`, `HF_TOKEN` and proxy variables from `.env` never reach the download
  child; it always uses `https://huggingface.co` without a token, and the pinned commit
  is checked by the Hub client.
- **RAM** (peak RSS of one child, int8, measured in the image): tiny 0.3 GB, medium 2.9 GB,
  large-v3-turbo 2.6 GB, large-v3 5.1 GB. The worker's `mem_limit: 8g` fits any of them.
- **CPU**: `whisper_cpu_threads` (default 4) threads per child. Keep it at or below the
  worker's `cpus: 6` quota.
- **Speed** (real-time factor = wall time / audio length, model load included, int8,
  4 threads, 61 s of English speech, measured 2026-10-22):

  | Model | Apple M-series, native | Same Mac, Docker (arm64) |
  |---|---|---|
  | tiny | 0.03 | 0.03 |
  | medium | 0.34 | n/a |
  | large-v3-turbo | 0.30 | 0.23 |
  | large-v3 | 0.64 | 0.49 |

  Expect a shared VPS vCPU to be roughly 2–3x slower (an estimate, not measured). **Use `large-v3-turbo` on
  the VPS**: large-v3 can approach real time there. Each 10 min chunk may run for
  `max(15 min, 3 x chunk length)` = 30 min (`LOCAL_RTF_BUDGET`), within the stage's
  100 min budget; a run that hits the budget resumes from the cached chunks.
- **Downloads are verified**: after the fetch, the required files must be present and
  model.bin must match the pinned SHA-256; only then is `.clipper-complete` written into the
  snapshot. A snapshot without that marker is fetched again, and one that fails
  verification is discarded and fetched once more before the job retries later.
- **Image**: faster-whisper and its native wheels (CTranslate2, onnxruntime, PyAV) add
  about 320 MB to the image.

## CI/CD

- **`ci.yml`** runs on every PR and on pushes to main: ruff, pytest (unit and integration against fixtures), Docker build, and Playwright tests for the review app.
- **`release.yml`** runs on a `v*` tag:
  1. Build the image and push `ghcr.io/<user>/clipper:<tag>`.
  2. SSH to the server and run `scripts/deploy.sh <tag>`.
- **`deploy.sh`**:
  1. Record the previous tag.
  2. Pin the new tag.
  3. Run `docker compose pull && up -d`.
  4. Poll `/healthz` and container health for 120 s.
  5. If the checks fail, redeploy the previous tag and exit non-zero.
- **`nightly-rebuild.yml`**:
  1. Rebuild the image with the latest yt-dlp.
  2. Smoke-test a metadata fetch and a 10 s section download.
  3. If the smoke test passes, auto-tag a patch release. If it fails, send a Discord alert.
- **Migrations** run when a service starts. They are additive only, so rolling back is always safe.

## Environments

- **local:** `docker compose` with an override file and a fixture mode. Use `clipper enqueue <url>` for manual runs.
- **prod:** the VPS. There is no staging environment in v1. New features roll out behind config flags, one creator at a time.

## Rollout sequence

1. Run the monitor only, in baseline mode, for 24 h. Verify that detection works.
2. Enable the worker for MrBeast only for 2 days. Review the clips and tune the prompt.
3. Add the PH creators (Taglish validation), then the streamers (Kai Cenat, IShowSpeed), with budgets in place.
4. Run a 48 h soak with all 6 creators, then 7 days unattended. v1 launches after that.

## Monitoring & alerts

- **Heartbeats:** monitor and worker each ping Healthchecks.io every 5 minutes, with a 15-minute grace period before an alert.
- **Discord alerts** fire on:
  - a job reaching `failed`
  - the `DownloadBlocked` signature
  - disk above 80%
  - a budget cap being hit
  - YouTube quota above 80%
  - Twitch auth failure
  - export failure

  Alerts are deduplicated: each alert key fires at most once per 30 minutes.

## Backups

- **Nightly:** take a SQLite `.backup`, then run `restic` to a Hetzner Storage Box or S3. The backup covers the database, `config/`, and `cookies.txt` (encrypted).
- **Retention:** 14 daily and 8 weekly snapshots.
- **Not backed up:** raw media, because it can be regenerated. Approved exports are synced to Drive.
- **Restore drill:** restore onto a laptop and confirm that `clipper status` reports the expected counts.

## Rollback

`scripts/deploy.sh <previous-tag>`. Because migrations are additive, the older code still runs against the newer schema.

## Runbook

See `docs/RUNBOOK.md` (written in E5-S8). It covers YouTube bot blocks, quota, stuck jobs, a full disk, budgets, Twitch auth, key rotation, rollback, restore, and adding a creator.
